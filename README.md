# RS41Configurator
This project is about reusing to [Vaisala RS41](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaisala) radiasonde.

## Introduction
RS41 Configurator is created to reprogram the weather sonde, so it can be reused for different purposes. It allows you for example to use it for HAM fox hunting, sonde hunters equipment testing, GPS mouse (NMEA) etc.

Avoid to set TX freguency between 400 - 406 Mhz and serial number format between C0000000 - Z9999999. This to avoid violating transmitting law regulations and weather sonde hunters reporting your RS41 into online systems (or knocking on your door before you know it ;-)
